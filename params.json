Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n![logo](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-32u0_Q61bmA/Vx46xA6q_II/AAAAAAAAAPk/_r6X6tkVgfc_881Hi1ZWdSOGsGiVLcZwwCCo/s912/WTe2-arcs.jpeg)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Bulk band structure and density of state(DOS)\r\n* Band structure of 2D slab system for any surface termination\r\n* Band structure of 1D wire/ribbon system for any surface terminations\r\n* Surface spectrum A(k,w) for 2D semi-infinite slabs with any surface termination\r\n* surface spectrum A(k1, k2, w=E0) for 2D semi-infinite slabs at fixed Fermi energy\r\n* Spin texture for 2D semi-infinite slabs\r\n* Wannier charge center or Wilson loop at any k plane in 3D Brillouin Zone\r\n* Berry curvature in any k plane in 3D Brillouin Zone\r\n* Berry phase in any k path in 3D Brillouin Zone\r\n* Landau level or Hofstadter butterfly spectrum\r\n* Check the Weyl point by calculating band gap in any k plane in 3D Brillouin Zone\r\n* Calculate mirror Chern number for any mirror invariant plane\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nQuanSheng Wu and ShengNan Zhang wrote the codes and prepare the formulas. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
