.. _bulkbandcalculation:

Bulk band calculation
---------------------
Calculate bulk energy band for a series k lines. This is the basic calculation after the
construction of Wannier functions. You have to compare your Wannier interpolated bands 
with the DFT bands. Those two bands should match well around the Fermi level.

1. The 1st column represents k points for the given kpath (KPATH_BULK)
2. The 2nd column is the energy level 
3. From the 3rd to the n'th column are the projected weight of the wave
   function at each k point and each band onto
   each wannier orbitals. Those weights are normalized 
   to 255 for the color plot convinence.

in NAMELISTS PARAMETERS ::

.. _sscalculation:

Surface state ARPES calculation
-------------------------------

One important feature for topological materials is the surface state. The bulk-edge correspondence 
tells us, if the topological property of the bulk system is nontrivial, then there will be
nontrivial states on the surface. Nowadays, there are several method to detect the surface states. 
One direct way is the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Such spectrum can be 
obtained by the iterative Green's function. 

.. NOTE::

 For slab calculations, please read carefully the input card :ref:`surface`

Input
^^^^^
::
 
  &CONTROL
  SlabSS_calc = T
  /
  &PARAMETERS
  OmegaNum = 101
  OmegaMin = -1.0
  OmegaMax =  1.0
  Nk1 = 101   ! No. of slices for the 1st reciprocal vector

  G 0.0 0.0 M 0.5 0.5

See :ref:`controlnamelist`, :ref:`parametersnamelist`, :ref:`kpathslab`

NP : integer valued, Number of principle layers, see details related to iterative green’s function. Used if  SlabSS_calc= T, SlabArc_calc=T, SlabSpintexture_calc=T. Default value is 2. You need to do a convergence test by setting Np= 1, Np=2, Np=3, and check the surface state spectrum. Basically, the value of Np depends on the spread of Wannier functions you constructed. One thing should be mentioned is that the computational time grows cubically of Np. 

.. _ssqpicalculation:

Surface state QPI calculation
-----------------------------

Settings for this feature are almost the same as :ref:`fermiarccalculation`. Only difference is that 
you should set  ::

   &CONTROL
   SlabQPI_calc          = T
   /
   
Output
^^^^^^

There are a lot of outputs for QPI calculation. including 
 arc.dat_l, arc.dat_r,     
 arc_l.gnu, arc_r.gnu,     
 arc_l_only.gnu, arc_l_only.gnu,

 arc_l_jdos.gnu, arc_l_jsdos.gnu,

 bulk contribution.

---------------------------------------------
Wannier charge center, which is sometimes called Wilson loop can be calculated by set WannierCenter_calc=T and set KPLANE_BULK CARD,  set number of k points for two vectors is Nk1, Nk2 in NAMELISTS PARAMETERS.  Notice: You should notice that the first vector in KPLANE_BULK CARD is the integration direction, this vector should be equal to one primitive reciprocal lattice vector.  If you want to calculate the Z2 number, Please set the second vector to be half of the reciprocal lattice vector. You can get the Wannier charge center  along the second k line. See more details In the paper written by Alexey. Soluyanov (2011).
