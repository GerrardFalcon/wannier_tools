We already developed a tool to symmetrize Wannier tight binding models. It can symmetrize your wannier90_hr.dat which made of 
s, p, d and f orbitals. However, it is not released and under testing. If you want to use this part, plase contact one of our 
developers Changming Yue (yuechangming8 at gmail.com).
