WannierTools
============

**WannierTools: an open-source software package for novel topological materials**

Source on Github : https://github.com/quanshengwu/wannier_tools

Aiming to investigate topoligical properties of 

* Electron systems (Tested)

* Phonon systems (Testing)


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :numbered: 3

   preliminaries
   tutorials

**Updates**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version V2.2.6

1. Discard the Miller indicies

2. Discard the third vector in the SURFACE card. The surface plane is specified only by two lattice vectors sitting on it.
